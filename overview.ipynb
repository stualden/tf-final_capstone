    "This project is large enough so that, unlike the previous Capstones, it seemed best distributed over a number of notebooks.  Here they are, in \"pipeline\" order (and also the order recommended for review):\n",
    "\n",
    "*  **overview.ipynb** - This notebook.\n",
    "*  **feature_\\*.ipynb** (one for each of six genres - blues, country, folk, jazz, new_age, and world) - Feature extraction from the digital music (MP3) files.\n",
    "    * These use the `libROSA` library of audio tools to extract statistics from the waveforms.\n",
    "    * They are separated by genre to facilitate a \"poor man's parallelization\" (running simultaneous notebooks on an 8-core processor) to speed up the run-times.\n",
    "    * The first genre (alphabetically) is **blues**, and that notebook includes some helpful visualizations on a single test track of music.  The remaining genre notebooks contain only the feature extraction code.\n",
    "* **ead_and_feature_selection.ipynb** - Basic feature analysis, including some supervised learning to discern feature importance, and PCA for potential dimensionality reduction.  The final step here is to write out files to be used as input to the supervised and unsupervised learning notebooks.\n",
    "* **supervised.ipynb** - Supervised algorithms applied to the features and tuned to maximize predictive performance.\n",
    "* **unsupervised.ipynb** -- Clustering algorithms applied to the features to evaluate the feasibility of prediction of existing genres and perhaps identification of not-yet-identified genres.\n",
    "* **summary.ipynb** - Conclusion, with summary of findings, obstacles, lessons learned, and suggested next steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note:\n",
    "* Because I've used `hvplot` in places, these notebooks may not show properly in Google Colab.  Please use nbviewer or native Jupyter Notebook instead if available.\n",
    "* For the presentation, I anticipate showing a subset of cells from all notebooks in the order listed above, subject to any recommendations from the reviewer.\n",
    "* Where useful, I'll be using the RISE notebook extension to show the cells as slides."

    "* I have a very large music library, built from ripping files off of my CDs and converting the files to MP3 format to save on storage space.  \n",

    "* Genre seems to be a function not only of instrumentation, but tempo, rhythm, volume and other factors."
